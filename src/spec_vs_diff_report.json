  "summary": "Frontend course icon mapping was extended with graceful fallback rendering, but the diff summary does not show added static icon assets and does not provide enough evidence that backend default course seeding was expanded as required. Unrequested changes/files were also introduced.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Expand the backend default course seeding (addDefaultCourses) to include a comprehensive UG/PG/Doctoral higher-education catalog across Science/Arts/Commerce, including degrees like B.C.A., B.B.A., M.B.A., M.C.A., LL.B., LL.M., B.Ed., M.Ed., B.Pharm, M.Pharm, MBBS, with non-empty titles/descriptions, using existing enums, and ensuring getAllCourses returns sorted by id without traps.",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated before showing the implementations of addScienceCourses/addArtsCourses/addCommerceCourses and the actual seeded course list. The diff summary does not contain evidence of new seeded courses being added or that the expanded catalog meets the comprehensive coverage described.",

      "reason": "No files under frontend/public/assets/generated are shown as added/modified in the diff summary; therefore the required icon PNG assets are not evidenced as present.",
