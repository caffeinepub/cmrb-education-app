  "summary": "Diff adds frontend Candid bindings (backend.did.ts), a deployment troubleshooting doc, a local env.json, a URL param utility, and updates backend/main.mo plus SubjectCard runtime guards. These changes generally align with resolving build/deploy issues and adding documentation, but the diff evidence is incomplete/contradictory in places (e.g., documentation references files/updates not shown in the added/modified file list), so full REQ-28 verification is limited to what’s visible.",
